# This repo contains solutions to all LeetCode problems I've solved

| No. | Problem Name | Description | Solution | Implementation |
| --- | ------------ | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| 1.  |  [Contains Duplicate](leetcode/containsDuplicate/containsDuplicate.py) | check if there are duplicates in the array | go through the array and store every number in a hashmap checking the hashmap if the number already exists...if it already exists then there's a duplicate otherwise not | with python we can use the Counter from collections framework to get a dictionary of the items with their counts. Then we can take the maximum value out of the values array of the dictionary and check if its greater than 1...if it is greater than 1 that means there exists a item that occurs twice/ has a duplicate |
| 2. | [Maximum Subarray](leetcode/maxSubarray/maxSubarray.py) | Find the subarray with largest sum and return it | Kadane's algorithm is used in this problem. | First we assume the first element to be the largest then we go through the array finding the current sum... if the current sum is greater than the maximum sum we update the max value to be equal to the current sum and return the max at the end. To find the current sum we take the max out of current value and the current value  + the current sum |
