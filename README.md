# This repo contains solutions to all LeetCode problems I've solved

> The python programs are mine, the C++ solutions are mostly generated by GitHub Copilot. I'm trying to learn C++ by comparing the solutions to the solutions I've already written in python.

| 217. | [Contains Duplicate](leetcode/containsDuplicate/containsDuplicate.py) | check if there are duplicates in the array       | go through the array and store every number in a hashmap checking the hashmap if the number already exists...if it already exists then there's a duplicate otherwise not        | with python we can use the Counter from collections framework to get a dictionary of the items with their counts. Then we can take the maximum value out of the values array of the dictionary and check if its greater than 1...if it is greater than 1 that means there exists a item that occurs twice/ has a duplicate                                 |
| 53.  | [Maximum Subarray](leetcode/maxSubarray/maxSubarray.py)               | Find the subarray with largest sum and return it | Kadane's algorithm is used in this problem.                                                                                                                                     | First we assume the first element to be the largest then we go through the array finding the current sum... if the current sum is greater than the maximum sum we update the max value to be equal to the current sum and return the max at the end. To find the current sum we take the max out of current value and the current value  + the current sum |
| 1.   | [Two sum](leetcode/twoSum/twoSum.py)                                  | Find the two numbers that add up to the target   | we can use a hashmap to store the values of the array and then check if the target - the current value is in the hashmap if it is then we have found the two numbers            | in python enumerate can be used to avoid lookup times with index values.....other stuff is pretty much the same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 88.  | [Merge Sorted arrays](leetcode/mergeSortedArray/mergeSortedArray.py)  | Merge two arrays into one sorted array           | there are zeroes in the array that we have to avoid in the nums1 array the first m elements are the numbers other n are zeroes that we don't have to include in the final array | in python its really easy...we just delete all the elements after m index with the del operator and slicing then we can extend the nums1 in place and sort it in place with the .sort() method                                                                                                                                                             |
